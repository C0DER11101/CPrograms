# C preprocessor
_The C preprocessor scans and modifies the source code before compilation(hence "preprocessor")._

**Main functions performed by preprocessor:**
1. Simple macro substitution.
2. Macros with parameters.
3. Conditional compilation.
4. File inclusion.
5. Error generation and pragma directives.

The lines starting with _\#_ are known as preprocessor directives.
