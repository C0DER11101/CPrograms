# Storage classes

_We can specify a storage class while declaring a variable._

**Syntax:**
```c
storage_class datatype variable_name;
```

**There are four types of storage classes:**

1. Automatic( _Keyword:_ `auto`).
2. External( _Keyword:_ `extern`).
3. Static( _Keyword:_ `static`).
4. Register( _Keyword:_ `register`).

So, variables can be declared as:
```c
auto int x;
extern float d;
static int y;
register int z;
```

_When the storage class specifier is not present in the declaration, compiler assumes a default storage class based on the place of declaration._

## 1. Automatic
_All the variables declared inside a block/function without any storage class specifier are automatic variables._

We may also use the keyword `auto` to declare automatic variables.

Automatic variables initially contain garbage values.

_These variables are automatic since the storage for them is reserved automatically each time when the control enters the function/block and is released automatically when the function/block terminates._

**All automatic variables are stored on the runtime stack.**

## 2. Register
_Register storage class can be applied only to automatic variables._

The scope of register variables is same as automatic variables.

**The register variables are stored in CPU registers.**

( _Registers are small storage units present in the processor._)

**Variables stored in registers are more quickly accessible than the variables stored in memory.**

_Register variables don't have memory addresses._

**Register storage class can be specified only for** `int`, `char` **and pointer types.**

_Register storage class specifier can be applied to formal arguments of a function unlike_ `static`, `extern` _and_ `auto`.

## 3. External
_Variables that have used by many functions and in different files can be declared as external variables._

*Initial value of an uninitialized external variable is zero.*

**Declaration of an external variable:** _The declaration of an external variable declares the type and name of the variable._
