# Scope
> Scope of an identifier is a region of the program text where the identifier is visible i.e. the region where it can be used._

The scope of an identifier is determined by the location where it is declared.

Four kinds of scopes:

1. Block scope.
2. Function scope.
3. File scope.
4. Prototype scope.

## 1. Block scope
> Identifiers declared in the beginning of a block or in the list of parameter declarations in a function definition have block scope.

**These identifiers are visible in the whole block and their scope terminates at the end of the block.**

_Block scope variables are also called **local variables.**_


## 2. File scope
> Identifiers declared outside any function(including `main()`) have file scope.

**An identifier which has file scope is visible in all functions from its point of declaration to the end of the source file in which it is declared.**

_Global variables and functions have file scopes._


## 3. Prototype scope
