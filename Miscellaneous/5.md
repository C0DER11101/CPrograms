# Command line arguments

_When_ `main()` _is called, it's called with two arguments._

_The first argument is_ `argc` _(for argument count), is the number of command-line arguments the program was invoked with._

_The second argument is_ `argv` _(for argument vector) is a pointer to an array of character strings that contain the arguments, one per string._

**Syntax:**
```c
int main(int argc, char*argv[])
{
	// code
	return 0;
}
```

**This is the simplest illustration of command line arguments: _the_** `echo` **_program_**.

```bash
echo hello, world
```

`argv[0]` is the name by which the program was invoked, so `argc` is atleast 1.

In the command above, the value of `argc` is 3 and `argv[0]`, `argv[1]` and `argv[2]` are `"echo"`, `"hello, "` and `"world"` respectively. So the last argument is `argv[argc-1]`.

_The standard requires that_ `argv[argc]` _be a null pointer._

Program:
[t14.c](https://github.com/C0DER11101/CPrograms/blob/CProgramming/Miscellaneous/tests/t14.c).

**Output:**

[This](https://github.com/C0DER11101/CPrograms/blob/CProgramming/Miscellaneous/tests/t15.c) program has the following outputs:

So, from the output above one thing is clear that some symbols are special and they have to be put within double quotes like in the output below:
