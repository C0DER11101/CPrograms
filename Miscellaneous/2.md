# const
_If any variable declared with_ `const` _qualifier, then the value of that variable can't be changed by the program._

**The** `const` **qualifier can occur in the declaration before or after the data type.**

Example:
```c
const int x=9;
int const y=9;
```
Here, `x` is a constant integer and `y` is also a constant integer.

_Any attempt to change the value of a constant variable in the program will result in an error!!_

**A constant variable can be given a value only through initialization or by some hardware devices.**

_If an array, structure or union is declared as const then each member in it becomes constant._

Example:
```c
const int arr[5]={1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

const struct
{
	char x;
	int y;
	float z;
}s={'A', 10, 45.5f};
```

The following structure declaration using `const` is _useless._
```c
const struct sample
{
	char x;
	int y;
	float z;
};
```

Because we know from [here](https://github.com/C0DER11101/CPrograms/blob/CProgramming/StructAndUnion/Basic.md#declaring-a-structure-type) that a no memory is reserved while declaring a structure so **what are we trying to make a constant exactly?! When there is no memory reserved for it. How can you make it store a constant value and make it unmodifiable?!**

_This is proved by [this](https://github.com/C0DER11101/CPrograms/blob/CProgramming/Miscellaneous/tests/t7.c)._

Here I have declared the exact useless constant structure `sample` and also created a variable. But unfortunately I was able to modify one of its members' value. So what's the point of declaring a const structure when you have to declare a constant structure variable separately? That's why it's useless. Also there is the memory concept that I just talked about. The `const` is used with a variable(be it an integer, float or even a structure or union) not with a structure declaration!!

_These are valid constant structure declaration:_
```c
const struct sample
{
	char x;
	int y;
	float z;
}s={'A', 10, 34.f};
```

```c
struct sample
{
	char x;
	int y;
	float z;
};

const struct sample s={'A', 20, 56.4f};
```

_We can use_ `const` _in a function's formal parameter._

Program:
[t8.c](https://github.com/C0DER11101/CPrograms/blob/CProgramming/Miscellaneous/tests/t8.c).
