# Storage classes

_We can specify a storage class while declaring a variable._

**Syntax:**
```c
storage_class datatype variable_name;
```

**There are four types of storage classes:**

1. Automatic( _Keyword:_ `auto`).
2. External( _Keyword:_ `extern`).
3. Static( _Keyword:_ `static`).
4. Register( _Keyword:_ `register`).

So, variables can be declared as:
```c
auto int x;
extern float d;
static int y;
register int z;
```

_When the storage class specifier is not present in the declaration, compiler assumes a default storage class based on the place of declaration._

## 1. Automatic
_All the variables declared inside a block/function without any storage class specifier are automatic variables._

We may also use the keyword `auto` to declare automatic variables.

Automatic variables initially contain garbage values.

_These variables are automatic since the storage for them is reserved automatically each time when the control enters the function/block and is released automatically when the function/block terminates._

**All automatic variables are stored on the runtime stack.**

## 2. Register
_Register storage class can be applied only to automatic variables._

The scope of register variables is same as automatic variables.

**The register variables are stored in CPU registers.**

( _Registers are small storage units present in the processor._)

**Variables stored in registers are more quickly accessible than the variables stored in memory.**

_Register variables don't have memory addresses._

**Register storage class can be specified only for** `int`, `char` **and pointer types.**

_Register storage class specifier can be applied to formal arguments of a function unlike_ `static`, `extern` _and_ `auto`.

## 3. External
_Variables that have used by many functions and in different files can be declared as external variables._

*Initial value of an uninitialized external variable is zero.*

**Definition of an external variable:** _The definition reserves storage for the variable as well as behaves as a declaration._

**Declaration of an external variable:** _The declaration of an external variable declares the type and name of the variable._

_The keyword_ `extern` _is specified in declaration but not in definition._

Consider a variable `salary`, it's definition will be written as:

```c
float salary;
```
It's declaration will be written as:
```c
extern float salary;
```

**Definition of an external variable:**

1. Definition creates the variable, so memory is allocated at the time of definition.
2. The variable can be initialized with the definition and the initializer should be constant.
3. The keyword `extern` is not specified in the definition.
4. The definition can be written only outside functions.

**Declaration of an external variable:**

1. Declaration doesnot create a variable, it only refers to a variable that has already been created somewhere, so no memory is allocated at the time of declaration.
2. There can be many declarations.
3. The variable cannot be initialized at the time of declaration.
4. The keyword `extern` is always specified at the time of declaration.
5. The declaration can be placed inside functions also.

Consider [this](https://github.com/C0DER11101/CPrograms/blob/CProgramming/Miscellaneous/tests/t16.c) program. Here, variable `x` will be available to all functions, it stays active from the point of its definition till the end of the program.

**Output:**

Now, look at [this program](https://github.com/C0DER11101/CPrograms/blob/CProgramming/Miscellaneous/tests/t17.c) program, the variable `x` is defined after `main()`, so it won't be accessible by `main()`(since the variable becomes active from the point of its definition). That's why we get the following error:

**Error:**

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96164229/215015340-be971e54-51bc-4a28-9860-1fdd09c58d22.png" width="60%" height="60%">

In this case, we have to provide the declaration of `x` inside `main()`.

Program: [t17_2.c](https://github.com/C0DER11101/CPrograms/blob/CProgramming/Miscellaneous/tests/t17_2.c).

**Output:**

## 4. Static
_There are two types of static variables:_

1. Local static variables.
2. Global static variables.

### 1. Local static variables
When the storage specifier `static` is applied to variables declared inside blocks, then the their storage class changes from automatic to static.

_The scope of a local static variable is same as that of a automatic variable._

The lifetime of a static variable is more than that of the automatic variable.

_A static variable is created at the compilation time and it remains alive till the end of the program._

It is not created and destroyed each time the control enters a function/block.

**A static variable is created only once and its value is retained between function calls.**

_A static variable is initialized only once(because it retains the value) and is not initialized everytime the function is called._

*A static variable can be initialized only by constants or constant expressions.*

**If a static variable is not explicitly initialized then by default it takes the value zero.**

```c
int x=8;
int y=x; /* valid */
static int z=x; /* invalid!! */
```

Program:
[t18.c](https://github.com/C0DER11101/CPrograms/blob/CProgramming/Miscellaneous/tests/t18.c).

**Output:**

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96164229/215034815-28e0768d-896a-47e0-91cb-218e84f508c9.png" width="60%" height="60%">

So, from the output above, one thing is clear that initialization of static variables is done only when you call the function for the first time, and after that no matter how many times you call that function there will be no initialization of the static variable.

### 2. Global static variable
In case of global variables, the `static` specifier is not used to extend the lifetime since global variables already have a lifetime equal to the life of program.

Here the `static` identifier is used for _information hiding_.

**If an external variable is defined as static then it can't be used by other files of the program. That variable is made private to  that file.**

I wrote these two files and compiled them:

[t19.c](https://github.com/C0DER11101/CPrograms/blob/CProgramming/Miscellaneous/tests/t19.c) and [t19p2.c](https://github.com/C0DER11101/CPrograms/blob/CProgramming/Miscellaneous/tests/t19p2.c).

And I got the following error:

**Error:**

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96164229/215250513-28f72d00-4bc8-47f9-ad3c-251f906c74c5.png" width="60%" height="60%">

The variable `y` was defined in `t19p2.c` and was private to it(`static` was used before `y`'s definition). That's why I got the error!!

Resolved programs:

[t20.c](https://github.com/C0DER11101/CPrograms/blob/CProgramming/Miscellaneous/tests/t20.c) and [t20p2.c](https://github.com/C0DER11101/CPrograms/blob/CProgramming/Miscellaneous/tests/t20p2.c).

**Output:**

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96164229/215250894-602ae438-6ad5-42b0-acd0-0ad5435e95b2.png" width="60%" height="60%">

# Storage classes specifiers in functions
_Storage class specifiers_ `extern` _and_ `static` _can be used with function definitions._

**The definition of a function without any storage class specifier is equivalent to its definition with the keyword** `extern` **`i.e. by default the definition of a function is considered external. If a function is external then it can be used by all the files of the all the files of the program and if it is** `static` **then it can be used only in the file where it is defined.**


_If an external function is to be used in another file, then that file should contain function declaration and it is a good practice to specify_ `extern` _in that declaration._
