# const
_If any variable declared with_ `const` _qualifier, then the value of that variable can't be changed by the program._

**The** `const` **qualifier can occur in the declaration before or after the data type.**

Example:
```c
const int x=9;
int const y=9;
```
Here, `x` is a constant integer and `y` is also a constant integer.

_Any attempt to change the value of a constant variable in the program will result in an error!!_

**A constant variable can be given a value only through initialization or by some hardware devices.**

_If an array, structure or union is declared as const then each member in it becomes constant._

Example:
```c
const int arr[5]={1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

const struct
{
	char x;
	int y;
	float z;
}s={'A', 10, 45.5f};
```

The following structure declaration using `const` is _useless._
```c
const struct sample
{
	char x;
	int y;
	float z;
};
```

Because we know from [here](https://github.com/C0DER11101/CPrograms/blob/CProgramming/StructAndUnion/Basic.md#declaring-a-structure-type) that no memory is reserved while declaring a structure so **what are we trying to make a constant exactly?! When there is no memory reserved for it. How can you make it store a constant value and make it unmodifiable?!**

_This is proved by [this](https://github.com/C0DER11101/CPrograms/blob/CProgramming/Miscellaneous/tests/t7.c)._

Here I have declared the exact useless constant structure `sample` and also created a variable. But unfortunately I was able to modify one of its members' value. So what's the point of declaring a const structure when you have to declare a constant structure variable separately? That's why it's useless. Also there is the memory concept that I just talked about. The `const` is used with a variable(be it an integer, float or even a structure or union) not with a structure declaration!!

_These are valid constant structure declaration:_
```c
const struct sample
{
	char x;
	int y;
	float z;
}s={'A', 10, 34.f};
```

```c
struct sample
{
	char x;
	int y;
	float z;
};

const struct sample s={'A', 20, 56.4f};
```

_We can use_ `const` _in a function's formal parameter._

Program:
[t8.c](https://github.com/C0DER11101/CPrograms/blob/CProgramming/Miscellaneous/tests/t8.c).

**Output:**

## Using `const` in pointer declaration
_We can declare 3 types of pointers using the qualifier_ `const`:
1. Pointer to constant data.
2. Constant pointer.
3. Constant pointer to constant data.

### _1._ Pointer to constant data
**Syntax:**
```c
const datatype* pointername;
```
**OR**
```c
datatype const* pointername;
```
**Example:**
```c
const int a=5, b=6;
const int*p=&a;
```
Here, we can make pointer `p` to store the address of another constant integer variable's address. But we cannot change the value in the address stored by `p`.

Program:
[t9.c](https://github.com/C0DER11101/CPrograms/blob/CProgramming/Miscellaneous/tests/t9.c).

**Error:**

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96164229/214502810-0487d504-77f2-4a5f-a432-12cdd192f494.png" width="60%" height="60%">

In the above program, I tried to change the value of `a` through the pointer `p` that's why it threw an error.

Program:
[t9_2.c](https://github.com/C0DER11101/CPrograms/blob/CProgramming/Miscellaneous/tests/t9_2.c).

**Output:**

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96164229/214502865-a8676666-5e4d-4cb0-902d-be835ccba418.png" width="60%" height="60%">

### _2._ Constant pointer
**Syntax:**
```c
datatype* const pointerName;
```
_Here, once we assign an address to the pointer, we can't modify that pointer again, i.e. we can't store address of another variable in that pointer._

Program:
[t10.c](https://github.com/C0DER11101/CPrograms/blob/CProgramming/Miscellaneous/tests/t10.c).

**Error:**

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96164229/214506110-09e61087-1ebc-44b2-a3c3-e0861b26fc2e.png" width="60%" height="60%">

In this above program I tried to modify `p` by assigning it the address of `b` when it already had the `address` of `a` in it. That's why I got this error.

Program:
[t10_2.c](https://github.com/C0DER11101/CPrograms/blob/CProgramming/Miscellaneous/tests/t10_2.c).

**Output:**

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96164229/214508083-a3521400-6522-4eb3-896a-dcb8c8572217.png" width="60%" height="60%">
