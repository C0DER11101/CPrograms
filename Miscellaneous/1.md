# Enumeration
_Enumeration type is a user defined data type, which can take values only from a user defined list of named integer constants called **enumerators**._

**Syntax:**
```c
enum tag
{
	member1,
	member2,
	.......
	.......
};
```
The syntax is same as that of structure and union.

Here `tag` is an identifier that specifies the name of the new enumeration type being defined and `enum` is a keyword.

`member1`, `member2`, ... are identifiers which represent integer constants and are called enumerator constants or enumerators. They **are not** _**variables**_. They **are** _**named integers constants**_.

We can declare the variables of `tag` as:

```c
enum tag var1, var2, var3;
```

Variables of `enum tag` can also be declared as:
```c
enum tag
{
	member1,
	member2,
	.......
	.......
}var1, var2, var3;
```
