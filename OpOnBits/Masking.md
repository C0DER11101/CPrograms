# Masking

> Masking is an operation in which we can selectively mask or filter the bits of a variable, such that some bits are changed according to our needs while the others remain unchanged.

_Masking is performed with the help of bitwise operators._

## 1. Masking using bitwise AND

Consider the following arbitrary bit pattern:

$b_1b_2b_3b_4b_5b_6b_7$
