# Union

_Union is a derived datatype like structures and it can also contain members of different data types._

**Syntax:**
```c
union union_name
{
	datatype member1;
	datatype member2;
	................
};
```

_**The main difference between** union **and** struct **is in the way memory is allocated for the members.**_

_Union variables can also be declared along with union declaration(like structure variables) or they can be declared separately._

_Each member in a structure has its own memory location._

_**Members of a union share the same memory location.**_
